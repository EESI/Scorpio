## Installation

You can set up the environment for `scorpio` using either a conda environment or a Docker image. Follow the instructions below for your preferred method:

### Method 1: Conda Environment

1. **Create a conda environment named `scorpio` based on the environment file in the `src` directory:**

    ```bash
    conda env create -f src/environment.yml -n scorpio
    ```

2. **Activate the conda environment:**

    ```bash
    conda activate scorpio
    ```

3. **Run the setup script to add `scorpio` to your PATH:**

    ```bash
    ./src/setup.sh
    ```

### Method 2: Docker

1. **Download and run the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull msalehr/scorpio
    docker run -it msalehr/scorpio
    ```

After following the steps for either method, your environment should be set up and ready to use the `scorpio` tool.
