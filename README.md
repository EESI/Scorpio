Welcome to the Scorpio project! This repository contains advanced tools for training triplet networks using contrastive learning on diverse DNA sequences and data from promoter detection, phylogenomic analysis, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, and any hierarchical information, which can improve downstream analysis and insights.

## Tutorials

The [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/MsAlEhR/Scorpio/wiki) also contains tutorials to help you learn how to use Scorpio tools with real data.

## Training Data

For training the gene-taxa model with full genes, we have included the data in this Zenodo record: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12964684). Please follow the instructions below to fully download the data. This data can be used with the `trainer` to train and save the model:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/api/records/12175913/files-archive -O scorpio-gene-taxa.zip
unzip scorpio-gene-taxa.zip -d scorpio-gene-taxa
```

## Models Available at Zenodo  

### Scorpio Models  
- **ScorpioBigDynamic**

### BigBird Model  
Our pre-trained model, **MetaBERTa**, a version of BigBird trained on gene sequences, is available here:

## Installation

You can set up the environment for `scorpio` using either a conda environment or a Docker image. Follow the instructions below for your preferred method:

### Method 1: Conda Environment

1. **Create a conda environment named `scorpio` based on the environment file in the `src` directory:**

    ```bash
    conda env create -f src/environment.yml -n scorpio
    ```

2. **Activate the conda environment:**

    ```bash
    conda activate scorpio
    ```

3. **Run the setup script to add `scorpio` to your PATH:**

    ```bash
    ./src/setup.sh
    ```

### Method 2: Docker

1. **Download and run the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull eesilab/scorpio
    docker run -it eesilab/scorpio
    ```

After following the steps for either method, your environment should be set up and ready to use the `scorpio` tool.
